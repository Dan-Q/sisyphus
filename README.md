# Sisyphus: The Game

Inspired by [a toot](https://octodon.social/@Tailsteak/109379857000006898) by [Mason "Tailsteak" Williams](http://tailsteak.com/), this is a silly web implementation of an imaginary board game, made while I was unwell ont he morning of 21 November 2022. You can play the game at [DanQ.me/sisyphus-the-game](https://danq.me/sisyphus-the-game).

Insofar as there's an explanation of it, [this blog post might be it](https://danq.me/2022/11/21/sisyphus-game/).

## How to play

Tap or click to roll the dice. In the unlikely event that you win, there's no animation or celebratory message.

### Rules

1. Roll two dice.
2. If you roll double-1, go back to the start.
3. Otherwise, move that many squares.
4. If you reach square 1000, you win!
5. If you overshoot square 1000, go back to the start.
